			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>"Welcome to my online gallery! My name is Prachi, and I am a self-taught artist based in India. I have always had a passion for art and painting, and I love exploring different mediums and styles to express my creativity.

My primary focus is on acrylic painting, and I love using bold and vibrant colors to create dynamic and expressive pieces. I draw inspiration from the natural world, including landscapes, animals, and flowers, as well as from my own personal experiences and emotions.

Each of my paintings is a unique and original piece, created with care and attention to detail. I believe that art has the power to bring joy, inspiration, and healing to our lives, and I am thrilled to share my work with you.

Please take a moment to browse through my gallery and discover the beauty and wonder of acrylic painting. If you have any questions or comments, I would love to hear from you. Thank you for your support and interest in my art!"</p>
